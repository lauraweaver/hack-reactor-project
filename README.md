### Project for Hack Reactor Admissions
* Includes high-order functions, native methods, and documentation per instruction request.
* The project is a rewriting of functional programming helpers
* The main purpose is to demonstrate an understanding of JS fundamentals.
* As a note, I do use "for...in" loops on arrays in this project when it is better for brevity under the collections section. I use an indexing for loop under the Arrays section. This was done purposefully to cut down on the line count and with the understanding that an array is a special type of object whose keys are masked as indexes. For example, "for i in collection" can reference the key in an object or the index of an array.
