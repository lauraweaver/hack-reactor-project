## Project for Hack Reactor Admissions

### What is this?
I rewrote a selection of functional programming helpers from Underscore.js.
* Includes high-order functions, native methods, and documentation per instruction request.
* The main purpose is to demonstrate an understanding of JS fundamentals.
* This code is packaged as a module for use with RequireJS.

## Instructions
If you want to run tests of all of the functions, execute `node tests.js`.
